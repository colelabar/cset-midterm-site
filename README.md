# CSET Semester 1 Mid-Term

## Purpose
This project served as the basis of our mid-term grade, and was a recreation (abeit a hard-coded and differently styled version) of the TechLancaster website. It included a calendar of upcoming meetups, an external link to the REAL TL website and Meetup.com, as well as a basic nav. This site was primarily used to grade us on our HTML, CSS, SASS, and responsive-development skills.
