      <li>Presume the value of others. Everyone’s ideas, skills, and contributions have value.
      </li>
      <li>Don’t assume everyone has the same context, and encourage questions.
      </li>
      <li>Encourage members and participants to listen as much as they speak.
      </li>
      <li>Strive to build tools that are open and free technology for public use.

      <li>Activities that aim to foster public use, not private gain, are prioritized.
      </li>
      <li>Work to ensure that the community is well-represented in the planning, design, and implementation of civic tech. This includes encouraging participation from women, minorities, and traditionally marginalized groups.
      </li>
      <li>Actively involve community groups and those with subject matter expertise in the decision-making process.

      <li>Ensure that the relationships and conversations between community members and participating organizations remain respectful, participatory, and productive.
